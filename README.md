# Auditing Ancestry: Considering the Algorithmic Ecology of the AncestryDNA Ethnicity Estimate

## Overview
This paper presents a qualitative audit of AncestryDNA's Ethnicity Estimate system using the Algorithmic Ecology framework. It examines how direct-to-consumer genetic testing services impact racialized communities and perpetuate historical patterns of datafication and racial classification.


## Methodology
The audit employs the Algorithmic Ecology framework developed by the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition and Free Radicals (2020), examining the algorithm's impact across four levels:
- Community
- Operational
- Institutional 
- Ideological
